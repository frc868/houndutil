     * Calculates the effective position of the target given the position, velocity,

     * though this is very often unnecessary.
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * When shooting a projectile while moving, the projectile inherits the
     * translational velocity of the chassis. Shooting on the fly can be
     * accomplished by targeting a "virtual" goal if you are moving, which acts to
     * negate the forces applied on the projectile due to the movement of the
     * chassis.
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * An iterative approach (see {@code goalPositionIterations}) is required
     * because the time taken for the projectile to travel to the target will change
     * given a different target location. To account for this, we re-simulate the
     * projectile's travel with a new shot time derived from the new virtual goal
     * position several times.
     * 
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * When solving this problem mathematically, the acceleration of the chassis
     * does not matter in the final velocities of the projectile (it will not
     * inherit the acceleration of the chassis). The
     * {@code accelerationCompensationFactor} is necessary due to other errors:
     * 
     * (1) the time taken to move the projectile through a shooter is non-zero, so
     * (2) if the chassis is accelerating, the velocity of the chassis by the time
     * the projectile leaves the robot will have changed.
     * 
     * To account for this, we multiply the acceleration at the time of the shot
     * <i>command</i> by a specific value and add it to the velocity at the time of
     * the shot. This value is based on the time delta between
     * commanding a shot and the shot actually leaving the shooter, meaning that the
     * effective velocity generated is the velocity as the projectile leaves the
     * shooter. This is extremely complicated to determine theoretically, so if you
     * find acceleration to be causing shot inaccuracies, find a value that provides
     * adequate compensation (should be around [0,2]).
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * The easiest way to create the {@code xyDistanceToProjectileVelocity} lambda
     * function is as follows:
     * 
     * If the speed of your shooter is always constant, simply create a lambda
     * expression that always returns the same value.
     * 
     * If the speed of your shooter is controlled using an
     * {@link InterpolatingTreeMap} based on distance from the goal, simply get the
     * appropriate shooter speed from that map, and multiply it by some constant
     * that describes how fast the projectile moves given a shooter speed. This can
     * be calculated experimentally by pointing a camera at the shooter and
     * calculating the speed of the projectile based on the distance travelled in n
     * frames. If you find the relationship between shooter speed and projectile
     * speed is not constant, you can create a second {@link InterpolatingTreeMap},
     * or define it as an equation.
